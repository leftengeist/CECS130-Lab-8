# Introduction to Programming Languages CECS130
## Lab 8.
### Programming assignment (100 pts): You have worked very hard on your phonebook program for many weeks and it is becoming a popular application with all your friends. You decide you want to compete with facebook.com and the next upgrade of your phonebook software should make contact data accessible even if the user closes your application and returns to it at a later time.
Add additional functionality to your phonebook program from lab# 7. Make it possible for users to:
  1. Store all entries in the phonebook into a location/file-name specified by the user.
  2. Retrieve entries from the location/file-name specified by the user.

If the user does not explicitly specify a path to the file, a default location of your choosing should be used.
